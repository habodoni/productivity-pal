# Productivity Pal - Software Modeling Project

A comprehensive software modeling and documentation project focused on designing a multi-platform workflow optimization system.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the complete modeling and documentation for Productivity Pal, developed by Hazem Abo-Donia and Benjamin Moks for the Modeling and Simulation course at Stevens Institute of Technology. The project demonstrates the application of various UML modeling techniques, software architecture design principles, and documentation practices in planning a productivity enhancement system.

## Project Focus

This project emphasizes:
- Comprehensive UML modeling and system design
- Software architecture documentation
- Agile development process documentation
- Detailed use case analysis
- System modeling using multiple diagram types

## Documentation Components

### UML Diagrams
- **Class Diagrams**: Illustrating system component relationships and structure
- **Activity Diagrams**: Depicting workflow processes and task transitions
- **Sequence Diagrams**: Showing interaction flows between system components
- **Use Case Diagrams**: Documenting system functionality and user interactions
- **Deployment Diagrams**: Mapping the physical architecture of the system
- **State Machine Diagrams**: Representing system state transitions
- **Communication Diagrams**: Showing message exchange patterns
- **Component Diagrams**: Illustrating high-level system organization

### Design Patterns
- Detailed documentation of the Singleton pattern implementation in WorkflowManager
- Architectural pattern considerations and justifications
- Component interaction design

### Requirements and Analysis
- Comprehensive use case documentation
- System requirements specification
- Architectural decisions and rationale

## System Architecture

The documented architecture includes detailed modeling of:

- **WorkflowManager**: Core system coordinator (Singleton pattern)
- **TaskTracker**: Activity monitoring system
- **AnalyticsEngine**: Data analysis component
- **NotificationService**: Alert management system
- **ApplicationManager**: External application interface

## Development Process Documentation

The project followed and documented an Agile development process:

- Detailed iteration planning and tracking
- Sprint documentation and reviews
- Team meeting notes and decisions
- Progress tracking through GitHub Project Boards

## Project Timeline

Documented project progression from November 2024 to December 2024, including:
- Initial requirements gathering and modeling
- Architecture design and documentation
- Iterative diagram refinement
- Final documentation and presentation
